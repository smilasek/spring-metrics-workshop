# spring-metrics-workshop

## Agenda

1. Familiarize with project
2. Micrometer
3. Metrics displayed in actuator
4. Metric types
5. Reactive streams metrics

Workshop is divided into multiple lessons (look for separate branches).

Because almost each lesson contains some tasks to do on your own,
try not to check out next lesson (which contains task solutions) before finishing previous one.
